                    <h2 class="param_h2">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="param_h2">Welcome to my blog post where I'll be sharing my thoughts on the recent games I've been playing. Whether you playing video games yourself or just curious about gaming, I hope you find something conspicuous here!</p>

        <div class="game-review">
            <h2 class="param_h2">Game 1: Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
            <p class="param_h2"> I got this game from my brother this year and let me tell you what, even after its rocky start I've come to like this game. The main storyline is filled with crucial choices which affect your ending and the game is filled with visually pleasing environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-review">
            <h2 class="param_h2">Game 2: theHunter Call of the Wild&#8482</h2>
            <p class="param_h2">Back in 2020, I got this game for free from Epic Games and after hundreds of hours in this game, I still can't get enough of it. The laidback gameplay enhances the game experience and you are free to choose whether you complete the missions or just hunt for fun.  </p>
        </div>

       <div class="game-review">
            <h2 class="param_h2">Game 3: Counter-Strike 2</h2>
            <p class="param_h2">I've been playing Counter-Strike games for 8 years now which have accumulated around 6500 hours in total. I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone who is into competitive games and is looking for a challenge. Counter-Strike 2 has had a pretty rough start but the competitive aspect is still there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-review">
            <h2 class="param_h2">Game 4: PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</h2>
            <p class="param_h2">PUBG has had its ups and downs but more recently the games state has lead to me not playing it as much as I used to. The game is more often than not filled with cheaters which makes the gaming experience unplayable. Even with weekly ban notices the game still doesn't appeal to me as much as it used to. </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="param_h2">Game List and Hours Spent</h2>
        <table class="game-list-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Game</th>
                <th>Hours Spent</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cyberpunk 2077</td>
                <td>30 H</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Counter-Strike 2</td>
                <td>58 H</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>theHunter: Call of the Wild&#8482</td>
                <td>61 H</td>
            </tr>
         
            <tr>
                <td>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</td>
                <td>12 H</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 class="param_h2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="param_h2">That wraps up my recent gaming experiences. I hope you've enjoyed reading about these games as much as I've enjoyed playing them. Feel free to give me feedback in the "Feedback" page!</p>

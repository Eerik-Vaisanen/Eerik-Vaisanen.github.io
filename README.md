The website: "https://eerik-vaisanen.github.io/index.html"
## The website grading:
* HTML 25%
* CSS 25%
* JS 25%
* Asynchronous Operations (25%)

## HTML
Website has basic HTML structure with clear content differentation (heading, paragraphs, lists) and uses forms, links and media. There is a table used on the homepage and consistent HTML semantic which enhances the structure and understanding of the content.

I'd give the HTML properities a full 5/5 since all the requirements are met.

## CSS
Basic styling such as fonts, colors and use of IDs for specific element styling is used often on the website. Responsive design is applied on the homepage and feedback page, but the videos and screenshots pages aren't mobile friendly. CSS flexboxes and grids are used when displaying images and videos on the webpage. 

I'd give a solid 4/5 for the CSS styling since all the other requirements are met apart from responsive design for mobile devices.

## JS
Simple interactions and use of functions such as dark theme button and the submission form. DOM manipulation and Object-Oriented Javascript principles are followed but are used very plainly.

I'd give 4/5 for the JS section since most of the requirements are met, but the JS functions and operations are very simple (validation for name, email, and message on the form validation and dark-theme button).

## Asynchronous Operations
Timers are not used in the website but AJAX call is used when loading the website and fetch is used in a local host server. When an error occurs an error is displayed on top of the website. 

Download the folder "testReceiver" and open the folder in VS Code and type node testReceiver.js in the terminal and submit a form in the "Feedback" page. You can check if the message was received from the form by going to "http://localhost:8080/get-form-data".

Data from the asynchronous call is not displayed on the webpage and filtering and sorting are not used on the website. All in all I'd give 2/5 or 3/5 for the asynchronous operations since some of them are used on the website, but the use of them is very simple.

## Conclusion
In total the website receives 15-16/20 points which equals to a grade 3. The HTML and CSS properities are consistent and even the JS scripts and asynchronous operations work properly.
